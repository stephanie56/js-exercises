# JavaScript Exercises!!!

Complete the exercises in this repo and push your solutions up to a branch (`firstname-lastname`).

Using your preferred editor, flesh out the functions in each exercise. You can test your work by running the test command:

```sh
$ npm run test
```

It'll watch the files for changes and keep running in your terminal so you can leave it open. The goal is to get all the unit tests to pass for each exercise.

You can also individually run every script in the command line by running `node exercise-1.js`.
